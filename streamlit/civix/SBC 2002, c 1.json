at a general meeting, on the\n            vote of a majority in interest as shown by the last confirmed assessment roll of the\n            water users' community, or if no assessment roll has been confirmed, then as ascertained\n            on the basis set out in subsection (1), may determine that, after the\n            determination, the interest of each member is in proportion to one or

determined by the majority in interest of the members voting on them.\n\n\nPower of manager to assess members\n56\n\n1\nThe manager of a water users' community may prepare an assessment roll\n            showing\n\na\nthe sums of money estimated to be required by the water users'\n              community\n\ni\nfor acquisition, construction, replacement and maintenance, repair and\n                operation of works, and\n\n\nii\nto pay the debts of the water users' community, and\n\n\n\nb\nthe sum assessed against each of the members of the water users' community,\n              which sum must

or an\n              amended assessment notice in accordance with subsection (3), and\n\n\nb\nsend a copy of the amended assessment roll to the comptroller.\n\n\n\n\nAppeals from assessments\n57\n\n1\nA member may appeal from the assessment made against the member by filing with\n            the comptroller, within 14 days after the mailing of the copy of the assessment roll or\n            the assessment notice, as the case may be, a statement showing the grounds of the\n            appeal.\n\n\n2\nThe comptroller, after the investigation the comptroller considers necessary,\n            may confirm the assessment roll or order its amendment.\n\n\n3\nIf no appeal from any assessment made in an assessment roll is taken, the\n            comptroller may confirm the assessment roll.\n\n\n\nAssessments binding\n58\nAn assessment roll confirmed under section 57 is binding on all\n          persons affected by it, and a sum payable by a member under it is deemed to be in arrears\n          30 days after the date of payment specified, and after that bears interest at a prescribed\n          rate.\n\n\nLiability for assessments\n59\n\n1\nA member of a water users' community is liable for that part of the debts of the\n            water users' community that is proportionate to the member's interest in the water\n            users' community.\n\n\n2\nOn

debts of the water users' community to those incurred before the notice was\n            given.\n\n\n3\nA purchaser of land to which water is conveyed through works controlled by a\n            water users' community is liable for the assessments made and the debts of the water\n            users' community incurred after his or her purchase of the land to the same extent as an\n            original member, unless and until the purchaser notifies the manager that he or she does\n            not wish to be a member of the water users' community.\n\n\n\nMeetings of members\n60\nAny 3 members may at any time call a general meeting of the water users' community\n          on giving 2 weeks' notice to all members who reside on land to which water is conveyed by\n          means of the works controlled by the water users' community.\n\n\nAmendment, recall or reissue of certificate or dissolution of water users'\n          community\n61\n\n1\nThe comptroller may at any time amend the certificate of incorporation of a\n            water users' community in any respect or may recall the certificate and issue another in\n            its place and, unless expressly provided in the amending or new certificate, the\n            amendment, recall or reissue does not impair the assets, rights, claims and financial\n            obligations of the water users' community.\n\n\n2\nThe comptroller may at any time cancel the certificate of incorporation of a\n            water users' community and make the disposition of the assets of the water users'\n            community that to the comptroller appears equitable, and unless an appeal is taken to\n            the appeal board from the comptroller's order and the appeal is allowed, the water\n            users' community is dissolved as soon as the time for appealing has expired.\n\n\n\n\n4\n\nRepealed\n62-67\n[Repealed 2014-15-200.]\n\n\n\n5\n\nDefinitions\n68-82\n[Repealed

the members of a water users' community, unless\n            altered under subsection (2), are proportionate to the respective maximum quantities of\n            water the members would be entitled to

         water users' community, or if no assessment roll has been confirmed, then as ascertained\n            on the basis set out in subsection (1), may determine that, after the\n            determination, the interest of each member is in proportion to one or both of the\n            following:\n\na\nthe area of the member's land irrigated by means of the works operated by the\n

at a meeting of a water users' community must be\n          determined by the majority in interest of the members voting on them.\n\n\nPower of manager to assess members\n56\n\n1\nThe manager of a water users' community may prepare an assessment roll\n            showing\n\na\nthe sums of money estimated to be required by the water users'\n              community\n\ni\nfor acquisition, construction, replacement and maintenance, repair and\n                operation of works, and\n\n\nii\nto pay the debts of the water users' community, and\n\n\n\nb\nthe sum assessed against each of

out the time and place for payment of the\n            assessments.\n\n\n3\nThe manager must deliver or send by registered mail to each member a copy of the\n            assessment roll, or the manager must post it in a conspicuous public place and send an\n            assessment notice to each member showing the amount assessed against the member and\n            stating where the assessment roll is posted.\n\n\n4\nA copy of the assessment roll must also be sent to the comptroller, together\n            with proof of compliance with the requirements of this section.\n\n\n5\nIf there is an error in the assessment roll, the comptroller may order its\n            amendment.\n\n\n6\nIf the assessment roll is amended under subsection (5), the manager\n            must\n\na\nprovide each affected member with a copy of the amended assessment roll or an\n              amended assessment notice in accordance with subsection (3), and\n\n\nb\nsend a copy of the amended assessment roll to the comptroller.\n\n\n\n\nAppeals from assessments\n57\n\n1\nA member may appeal from the assessment made against the member by filing with\n            the comptroller, within 14 days after the mailing of the copy of the assessment roll or\n            the assessment notice, as the case may be, a statement showing the grounds of the\n            appeal.\n\n\n2\nThe comptroller, after the investigation the comptroller considers necessary,\n            may confirm the assessment roll or order its amendment.\n\n\n3\nIf no appeal from any assessment made in an assessment roll is taken, the\n            comptroller may confirm the assessment roll.\n\n\n\nAssessments binding\n58\nAn assessment roll confirmed under section 57 is binding on all\n          persons affected by it, and a sum payable by a member under it is deemed to be in arrears\n          30 days after the date of payment specified, and after that bears interest at a prescribed\n          rate.\n\n\nLiability for assessments\n59\n\n1\nA member of a water users' community is liable for that part of the debts of the\n            water users' community that is proportionate to the member's interest in the water\n            users' community.\n\n\n2\nOn disposing of the land to which is appurtenant the licence on which his or her\n            membership is based and notifying the manager, a member may limit his or her liability\n            for the debts of the water users' community to those incurred before the notice was\n            given.\n\n\n3\nA purchaser of land to which water is conveyed through works controlled by a\n            water users' community is liable for the assessments made and the debts of the water\n            users' community incurred after his or her purchase of the land to the same extent as an\n            original member, unless and until the purchaser notifies the manager that he or she does\n            not wish to be a member of the water users' community.\n\n\n\nMeetings of members\n60\nAny 3 members may at any time call a general meeting of the water users' community\n          on giving 2 weeks' notice to all members who reside on land to which water is conveyed by\n          means of the works controlled by the water users' community.\n\n\nAmendment, recall or reissue of certificate or dissolution of water users'\n          community\n61\n\n1\nThe comptroller may at any time amend the certificate of incorporation of a\n            water users' community in any respect or may recall the certificate and issue another in\n            its place and, unless expressly provided in the amending or new certificate, the\n            amendment, recall or reissue does not impair the assets, rights, claims and financial\n            obligations of the water users' community.\n\n\n2\nThe comptroller may at any time cancel the certificate of incorporation of a\n            water users' community and make the disposition of the assets of the water users'\n            community that to the comptroller appears equitable, and unless an appeal is taken to\n            the appeal board from the comptroller's order and the appeal is allowed, the water\n            users' community is dissolved as soon as the time for appealing has expired.", "attributes": {"id": "d2e4189"}, "level": 2, "children":
